NEXUS

running link : https://iitrop.vercel.app/

so basically we made this project for college students. it solves some daily problems we face in campus.

what this project does:

1. mess menu - checks what food is there today (so u know if u need to order from outside).
2. cab share - helps find people to share cab with so it costs less money.
3. marketplace - like clean olx for students to sell books and stuff.
4. mails - easier way to check important notices.
5. lost and found - if u lost ur id card or something find it here.

how we made it:
we used react.js for the frontend part because it is good for making websites.
for design we used tailwind css to give it that glass effect look.
backend is in python because python is easy to write.
used vite to make it fast.

how to run it:

1. download this folder.
2. open terminal and go to frontend folder.
3. type npm install to get all packages.
4. type npm run dev to start the website.
5. thats it, it should work on localhost.

thanks.
